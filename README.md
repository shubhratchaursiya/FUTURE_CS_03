## 📖 Task Overview
This task focuses on analyzing security risks associated with API endpoints. The objective is to identify common API security issues such as missing authentication, excessive data exposure, and lack of rate limiting, and to provide clear remediation recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objectives of this task are to:
- Analyze API endpoints for security weaknesses  
- Identify authentication and authorization issues  
- Detect data exposure and rate-limiting gaps  
- Recommend mitigation measures using simple, professional language  

---

## 🌐 Scope of Assessment
- **APIs Tested:** Public test/demo APIs  
  *(e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)*  
- **Testing Type:** Basic & Non-Intrusive API Security Analysis  
- **Assessment Coverage:**
  - Authentication & authorization  
  - Data exposure risks  
  - Input validation  
  - Rate limiting  

⚠️ No destructive or intrusive testing was performed.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Postman / Insomnia** – API request testing  
- **Browser Developer Tools** – API inspection  
- **Public Test APIs** – Endpoint analysis  
- **Canva / Google Docs** – Report preparation  
- **GitHub** – Documentation and submission  

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Selected publicly available test APIs  
2. Sent API requests using Postman  
3. Observed API responses and exposed data  
4. Checked authentication and authorization requirements  
5. Reviewed rate limiting and input validation  
6. Identified security risks  
7. Documented findings and remediation steps

## 🚨 Identified API Security Risks

### 🔴 Missing Authentication
- **Risk Level:** High  
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access and potential data leakage  

### 🟠 Excessive Data Exposure
- **Risk Level:** Medium  
- **Impact:** Exposure of unnecessary or sensitive information  

### 🟡 Missing Rate Limiting
- **Risk Level:** Low  
- **Impact:** Increased risk of abuse or denial-of-service attacks
